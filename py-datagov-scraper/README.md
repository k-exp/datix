```python

def dot():
    """
    Dot product of two arrays.

    For 2-D arrays it is equivalent to matrix multiplication, and for 1-D
    arrays to inner product of vectors (without complex conjugation). For
    N dimensions it is a sum product over the last axis of `a` and
    the second-to-last of `b`::

        dot(a, b)[i,j,k,m] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[k,:,m])

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        First argument.
    b : array_like
        Second argument.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
        if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
        C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
        for `dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
        conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
        to be flexible.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are both
        scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise
        an array is returned.
        If `out` is given, then it is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the last dimension of `a` is not the same size as
        the second-to-last dimension of `b`.

    See Also
    --------
    vdot : Complex-conjugating dot product.
    tensordot : Sum products over arbitrary axes.
    einsum : Einstein summation convention.
    matmul : '@' operator as method with out parameter.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.dot(3, 4)
    12

    Neither argument is complex-conjugated:

    >>> np.dot([2j, 3j], [2j, 3j])
    (-13+0j)

    For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:

    >>> a = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
    >>> b = [[4, 1], [2, 2]]
    >>> np.dot(a, b)
    array([[4, 1],
           [2, 2]])

    >>> a = np.arange(3*4*5*6).reshape((3,4,5,6))
    >>> b = np.arange(3*4*5*6)[::-1].reshape((5,4,6,3))
    >>> np.dot(a, b)[2,3,2,1,2,2]
    499128
    >>> sum(a[2,3,2,:] * b[1,2,:,2])
    499128

    pass
